    <h1> UAE and India sign Pact on Kashmir | Is Israel Next?</h1>
    <img src="./images/bannerImage.png" alt="India and Uae sign Pact">
    <p>"This [signing of MoU] is a major success for India in the context of both
        Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir as OIC [Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]
        members have always kept Pakistan's sensibilities on Kashmir at the forefront,"
        <br>
        Basit said.
        <br>
        "In the past, they [OIC member nations] have never done something to make
        Pakistan feel that Muslim nations and the OIC are not standing behind us on
        the Kashmir issue.
        <hr>
        "They may not have been very vocal, but have ensured not to work against our
        sentiment on Kashmir. That's why we saw many times that representatives of
        the OIC nations used to refrain from visiting Kashmir. Many times, even if they
        were invited, the OIC nations kept in mind the feelings of Pakistan," he said.</p>
